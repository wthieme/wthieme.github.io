<h2>Privacy Policy Yavalath</h2>

<p><h3><i>English</i></h3></p>
<p>I, Wilhelm Thieme, built the Yavalath app as a free app. This app is provided by me at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
<p>This privacy policy is used to inform you about my policies regarding collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Information collection and use</strong></p>
<p>To be able to play Yavalath you are required to provide a nickname. All information, including the nickname, 
that is provided by the user during a game will be stored temporarily for use during the game only. 
No personal information is collected by my app.
<p><strong>Location service</strong></p>
<p>Yavalath uses the network location service of the device the be able to determine the country. On Android 6 and up it is
possible to deny the use of the location service. The Yavalath app will function normally if you do so. The only thing that will 
be missing is the name of the country in the available players list. 
</p>

<p>I want to inform you that whenever you use my app, that some statistical log data will be collected through 
Google's automated log services. This log data may include information such as your devicesâ€™s device name, 
operating system version, the time and date of your use of the app and some other anonymous statistics.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. 
I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. 
These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.</p>
